# Events

SwiBots is an event-driven framework. This means that the framework is designed to respond to events. Events are the primary way that SwiBots interacts with the outside world. Events are generated by the network, by the user, or by the framework itself. Events are handled by [handlers](./handlers).

## Event types

There are several types of events that can be handled by SwiBots:

#### `Generic event`
All events inherit from the `Event` class. This class contains the following properties:

- `type:EventType` - The type of the event.
- `community_id:str` - The ID of the community where the event was triggered.
- `community:Community`- The community where the event was triggered.
- `channel_id:str`- The ID of the channel where the event was triggered.
- `channel:Channel`- The channel where the event was triggered.
- `group_id:str` - The ID of the group where the event was triggered.
- `group:Group` - The group where the event was triggered.
- `action_by_id:str` - The ID of the user that triggered the event.
- `action_by:User` - The user that triggered the event.

### Chat events

#### `MessageEvent`
A message was sent to a chat.

**Additional properties:**

A command was sent to a chat.

**Additional properties:**
